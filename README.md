Project: Web Scraping
Author: Andrea Riley(Thiel)

## Feature Tasks

- Scrape a Wikipedia page of your choosing and record which passages need citations.
  - E.g. History of Mexico has a few “citations needed”.
- Your web scraper should report the number of citations needed.
- Your web scraper should identify those cases AND include the relevant passage.
  - E.g. Citation needed for “lorem spam and impsum eggs”
  - Consider the “relevant passage” to be the parent element that contains the passage, often a paragraph element.
